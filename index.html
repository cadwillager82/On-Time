<hi> Hi there! Test,Test,Test </h1>

<p> Not long ago as I recall; I happened upon a man creeping around in my shrubberies. I snuck up where he couldn't see or hear me approaching. Then I eased up to where I could smell this awfull 'oder' comming from 'the shrubberies'. So I stuck 'out my hand to help him up'. I said what 'are you' doing in my shrubberies? Nerveously the man replied that he was sent to me. Why? I retorted; And because of the confidential nature of the ensuing conversation, I found shelter,food and a shower for him.

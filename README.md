# On-Time
Test, Test, Test
  
This is without a doubt one of the more noteable periods in my life.  I need to figure out why certain things act the way they do and why others not so much. So I am going to take On Time on a Test, Test, Test.

I plan by the end of the testing period to have gained a better knowledge of how certain elements interact with eachother in a set of varying circumstances. Just so everyone that might happen upon this lowly test and read this, Honestly I really do not have a clue about this. _help_ would be greatly appreciated.

'_So lets do this thing_'!  This thing really does work '**amazing**'
